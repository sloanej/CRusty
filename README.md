# CRusty

## Project Description
CRusty is a research project by Jack Sloane, Mathew Jackson, and Ishaan Gulati for a graduate level Programming Languages course at Virginia Tech. The problem that we investigate in this project is: How should developers go about updating legacy C code into memory safe Rust code? We look at the current research and methods related to automatic C to Rust translation tools. Then we compare these methods with manually translating legacy C systems to Rust.

See "CRusty Project Report" for more details.
